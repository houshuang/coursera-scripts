# Coursera Scripts

This repository contains scripts and workflows used by the [Open.UToronto](http://www.ocw.utoronto.ca/) group and [the Office of Online Learning Strategy](http://onlinelearning.utoronto.ca/?page_id=5) at [the University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.com/) to process and analyze learning analytics data from [our Coursera MOOCs](https://www.coursera.org/utoronto). Read more about [our research program](http://www.ocw.utoronto.ca/open-course-development/).

The scripts are under rapid development, and primarily used once or a few times, in an exploratory fashion. Therefore, do not expect solid and well-documented software packages. We are sharing them in the hope of contributing to a culture of sharing workflows, scripts and approaches among Coursera partner universities.
